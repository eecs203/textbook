# EECS 203 Textbook

## What's this?

I don't know yet! It is in the process of becoming. The general idea we had at the start of the summer of 2022 was to switch to an online, interactive textbook whose content we control. Rosen is a decent text, but it often has too much detail or too little detail pertinent to the topics we teach, as well as a substantial amount of information that we don't teach. Hopefully this book can deliver just the content we want as effectively as possible.

## Quick Links and Tips

I recommend editing PreTeXt in VS Code.

General PreTeXt setup information can be found [here](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/quickstart-getting-pretext.html). Once this is installed your general workflow will be running `pretext build web` when you want to build the project, and `pretext view web` to start the server to view it.

A general introduction to how PreTeXt works can be found [here](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/overview.html).

Specific guidance on how to create interactive exercises can be found [here](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/topic-interactive-exercises.html).

[This section](https://pretextbook.org/examples/sample-book/annotated/rune.html) of a sample algebra textbook also provides some examples of how to integrate Runestone interactivity through PreTeXt.
